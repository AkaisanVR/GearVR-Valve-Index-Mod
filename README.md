Hello there! this a guild how to assemble and setup the GearVR Valve Index Mod. 

	1. Heat up the displays to soften the glue holding in the lenses. Preferably a white screen and have the headset at 160% display brightness.

	2. Use a plastic spudger to remove the first frenel lens. push the plastic spudger into the middle of the flat part of the lens and shimmy the spidger slowly to either or the top or bottom of the lens. (preferably the top)

	3. Remove the 2nd focus lens with the same process

 	4. Prepare the eyetube by making sure no dust or 3d print crumbs are not in the eyetube

	5. Insert the GearVR Lens into the lens carrier

 	6. Insert the GearVR Lens plus carrier into the eyeube

  I am not responcible for the loss of waranty status and irreversable damage
