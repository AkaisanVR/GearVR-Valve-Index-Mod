Hello there! this a guild how to assemble and setup the GearVR Valve Index Mod. 

	1. Heat up the displays to soften the glue holding in the lenses. Preferably a white screen and have the headset at 160% display brightness.

	2. Use a plastic spudger to remove the first frenel lens. push the plastic spudger into the middle of the flat part of the lens and shimmy the spidger slowly to either or the top or bottom of the lens. (preferably the top)

	3. Remove the 2nd focus lens with the same process

 	4. Prepare the eyetube by making sure no dust or 3d print crumbs are not in the eyetube

	5. Insert the GearVR Lens into the lens carrier

 	6. Insert the GearVR Lens plus carrier into the eyeube

  I am not responcible for the loss of waranty status and irreversable damage

  Results:

	Fov: H:110 V:84
 	1. Clarity is edge to edge, everything is fully in focus even in the corners of the screen
 	2. The sweetspot is the whole lens but I commened spending some time getting it perfectly centred with IPD to get less chromatic aberrations 

 (Destortion Correction for now is not set up, I am planning on working on it in the future)

 The new GearVR lens system causes the displays to be a hint brighter than the stock lenses due to the lack of the 2nd lens potentially loosing light. 

 Pros: 

 
	1. Edge to edge clearity 
	2. Improved Colours
	3. No Glare
	4. Screen Door Effect is less noticeable 

 Cons: 


	1. There isnt a destortion profile (for now)
 	2. Possible damge to lenses or lens tube when removing the old lenses 
 	3. Dust contamination in the eyetube
 	4. Loss of warranty
